Cat Flat
========
Cat Flat is a brutally realistic virtual reality simulation game, about a large amount of cats living in a small room, with only a few bowls of food. You can resupply their food\*, but they will inevitably perish. Some cats live longer than others, some are bigger, some last longer on the same food. It's a cruel world out there.

\* by aiming at the bowl and clicking or just gazing for a bit in VR.
